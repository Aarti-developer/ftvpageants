            <p>
              This policy applies to all visitors to FashionTV's Undergarments.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Information covered by this Policy <br />
              This policy applies to information collected and processed by
              FashionTV consisting of the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              2.1 Personal information is information related to a visitor or a
              combination of pieces of information that could reasonably allow

              information such as date of birth in isolation may not be enough
              to identify the visitor uniquely, a combination of full name and
              date of birth may be sufficient to do so. The Personal Information
